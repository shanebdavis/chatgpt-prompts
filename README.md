## [5-Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)

> Five whys (or 5 whys) is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" five times. The answer to the fifth why should reveal the root cause of the problem. [5 Whys on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)

I find this process very useful, but I have a very hard time doing it myself. This ChatGPT prompt has helped me finally successfully apply the process.

### Prompt

> I want you to help me with the "5 whys process." I am going to provide a statement and I want you to ask my why I that statement is true. Please ask a specific why-question related to me statement. I don't want you to ask me about why delivering value to the customer is good. I want each of your why questions to ask about a different subject from any of the previous questions.

Then follow the rubric. When done:

> I'm done how. Can you please summarize what we talked about?
